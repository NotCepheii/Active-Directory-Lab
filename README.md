# Active-Directory-Lab

(REVISING ATM)

Good morning all,

I am Leo Roel Manalansan, I am new to IT/Cyber realm. I am here to explain how Active Directory works and how to set up a lab. This is for my own learning purposes to enable to maintain this information and use this as reference. This is going to be a short explanation for my end.

First things first please download one of the 3 following applications that is needed in order to create this lab! If you do not know how to set up virtual machines please view this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM (Network Chuck!)

Also for spec wise it depends on your system. I run like Processor	Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz, 3600 Mhz, 8 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s) & RAM is 16 GBs at least. Be forewarn to ensure you KNOW what you are doing with settings (memory requirements/processor) within your virtual machine, too much can take a toll on your computer. (Read this on why: https://www.crucial.com/articles/about-memory/how-much-ram-does-my-computer-need)

Now you set up your virtual machine... now let us have fun!

This diagram pretty much explains what I am doing.

Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MHsI8hJmggI&t=334s (Josh Makador explains on how to the lab!)

With his explanation; pretty much I followed his video step by step. There is a few discrepancies that he made which later on he explained. He explained on the diagram on what he is doing too as this was my reference.

It was a lengthy process! IT TOOK me an ENTIRE 5 hours! However, the experience was worth it now I have a AD Lab which is essential for system administrator roles. I think that is all for now guys! It is short since I want to share my personal journey, but you will make sure you got to pay attention to detail or else things will not run smoothly. 

What I learn is: how to set up virtual machine, how to use DHCP, static IP, organizational units, powerscript shells (which generated 1K users), creating a domain, active directory users and computers...

That is all for now! Thanks for reading.
