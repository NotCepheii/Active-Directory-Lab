# Active-Directory-Lab

Good morning all,

I am Leo Roel Manalansan, I am new to IT/Cyber realm. I am here to explain how Active Directory works and how to set up a lab. This is for my own learning purposes to enable to maintain this information and use this as reference. 

First things first please download one of the 3 following applications that is needed in order to create this lab! If you do not know how to set up virtual machines please view this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wX75Z-4MEoM (Network Chuck!)

Also for spec wise it depends on your system. I run like Processor	Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700K CPU @ 3.60GHz, 3600 Mhz, 8 Core(s), 8 Logical Processor(s) & RAM is 16 GBs at least. Be forewarn to ensure you KNOW what you are doing with settings (memory requirements/processor) within your virtual machine, too much can take a toll on your computer. (Read this on why: https://www.crucial.com/articles/about-memory/how-much-ram-does-my-computer-need)

Now you set up your virtual machine... now let us have fun!
